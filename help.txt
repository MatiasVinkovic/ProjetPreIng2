You are probably wondering “what do I need to enter into the terminal to get these results?”. Here is the command to write in your terminal to launch the program (don't forget to place yourself in the folder that contains our files using the cd command):

bash script.sh data.csv -d1 -d2 -l -s -t (WARNING: this command only works for a .csv file)

P.S.: You have the freedom to execute orders individually according to your needs. To do this, use the following syntax: "bash script.sh data.csv [...]" specifying the desired options.
